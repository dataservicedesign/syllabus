abstract: "In this lecture, we will explore projects where a data-driven mindset played a central role in tackling complex design challenges. We will examine how data serves as a powerful tool throughout every phase of the design process—from sparking inspiration in the initial research stage to driving innovation in the ideation phase and, ultimately, shaping the implementation of services and products. Through practical examples, we will see how visualizing, interpreting, and leveraging data effectively can lead to more insightful and impactful design solutions."
