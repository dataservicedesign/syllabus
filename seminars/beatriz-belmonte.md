abstract: "Traditional frameworks of service design use a time-based structure that goes from the awareness (before) to the post-service (after) experience. However, in the case of digital public service, particularly administrative services, the service cycle starts the moment a procedure is drafted and it enters the government operational path. In this session, we will visit this path to understand how the decisions made along this process shape the services and impact the design of personalised and proactive public services."
